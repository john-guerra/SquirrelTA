This is a dummy project for my DBs class using Node + Express + Sqlite
By John Alexis Guerra Gomez

I'm doing this project as part of the requiremens for cs5200 Database management systems with the kind and wonderful professor of John Guerra


## How to run it

Requires node + express + sqlite

```
npm install
npm start
```

Go to the http://localhost:3000


## Database

The database for this project uses sqlite, you don't need to install anything just run the `npm install`, and to initialize the data just run

```
node initialize.js
```
